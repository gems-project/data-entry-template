📄 Data Entry Template Overview

This Excel template is designed to standardize data collection across livestock experiments focused on methane emissions and related traits. The sheets are organized into thematic sections described below.

🐄 Animal and Experiment Metadata

The **AnimalCharacteristics** sheet records identifiers, sex, breed, birthdate, and other individual animal traits. The **ExperimentalDesign** sheet documents study-level metadata such as trial period, treatment groups, diet codes, housing conditions, and intake measurement methods.

🌾 Feed and Intake Data

Information about animal diets is recorded in **FeedComponents** (general feed ingredients and proportions) and **GreenFeedPelletComponents** (specific to GreenFeed concentrate pellets). Daily-level feed consumption is entered in **IntakePerDay**, while **IntakeIntraday** allows for higher-resolution intake recordings throughout the day.

🌽 Diet Composition and Digestibility

The **DietNutrientComposition** sheet captures the calculated nutritional content of each diet, typically based on lab analysis or feed library values. The **Digestibility** sheet stores results from fecal collection trials or markers used to estimate nutrient digestibility.

🥛 Production Data

The **Milk** sheet includes milk yield and composition metrics like fat, protein, and lactose. The **BodyWeight** sheet tracks body weight measurements.

🌱 GreenFeed Data

For projects using the GreenFeed system, **GreenFeedSettings** includes device configuration and calibration parameters. **GreenFeedDataFileReference** lists the source data files provided by c-Lock. Actual CH₄ and CO₂ emission data measured by the GreenFeed system is entered in **GreenFeedGasMeasurement**.

🧫 Respiration Chamber Data

If emissions are measured in respiration chambers, the **RespirationChamberSettings** sheet details the equipment and setup parameters, while the **RespirationChamberMeasurement** sheet contains the resulting emission data for each animal and timepoint.

## GEMS Gold Export API (Databricks CSV)

REST API documentation, Azure deployment (including Cloud Shell vs PowerShell), zip packaging, and troubleshooting: **[API/README.md](API/README.md)** (also **`DEPLOY_AZURE.md`** in that folder for CLI quick reference).
