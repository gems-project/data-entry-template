## Purpose

This memo provides standardized instructions for completing and sharing the **GEMS Data Entry Workbook** under the Data Access and Use Agreement (DUA) as part of the international data consolidation initiative.

---

## 1. Study and Template Assignment

Each Excel workbook corresponds to **one study only**.

- The number of Data Entry Workbooks sent to you matches the number of studies listed in your DUA table.
- Please complete the Data Entry Workbook in the **chronological order specified in the DUA table**.
- Each file name must begin with the **global study sequence number** assigned by the GEMS coordination team, followed by your lab name and your internal study number.

**Example file naming convention:**
```
001_LabName_1
002_LabName_2
```

This ensures that file names and study references remain consistent across submissions.

## 2. File Access and Editing

Data Entry Workbooks are shared **only with the designated Data Manager** listed in the DUA table for each study. The Data Manager is responsible for coordinating data entry within their team.

Contributors must work **directly in the shared online workbook** using **Microsoft Teams or SharePoint**.

If additional team members need to assist with data entry:

- They may work temporarily in a **downloaded copy** solely for the purpose of transferring information.
- **All finalized data must be pasted into the shared online workbook** by the Data Manager.

Only the **online shared version** is considered the official submission.

> Files completed or submitted outside the shared environment will **not** be accepted.

## 3. Checklist and Completion Tracking

Each workbook includes a **“Checklist”** sheet to record progress.

- You must update the **Status row** for every sheet after completing data entry.
- Acceptable final status options are:
  - `Not relevant`
  - `Completed`

One of these must be indicated for **all sheets**, otherwise the data will not be processed.

A **Notes** row is also available for leaving comments or questions for the coordination team.

After all sheets are marked as *Not relevant* or *Completed*:

1. The GEMS coordination team will begin data processing and quality control.
2. You will receive a **data quality report** with feedback.
3. Please revise entries until the report indicates the data are **fully verified**.

## 4. Microsoft Account Access

If you cannot open the shared document, please create a **Microsoft account using the same email address** that received the shared link.

---

## 5. Acknowledgment

Contributors confirm that they have read and understood these instructions by **beginning data entry in the shared workbook**.

No separate shared tracker file is required.
